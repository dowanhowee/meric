Hello world! I'm a new code learner.
I just know a few things in python and also i dont know how to code in other languages and yet i'm still learning python.
I don't even know the loops but i tried so hard to figure this out.I'm still learning if-else commands.
So i made a game that 2 dices are rolling by computer and you have to guess which number came on the top side of dice or dices.
If you can guess only one dice you get 1 health and 1 joker, if you can guess two dices then you will get 2 health and 1 joker.
If you can't guess the numbers then your health is going to decrease as 1 point.
If you already have joker and you guess the next numbers/number then your joker is going to be used but yours health is going to increase
as 1 point.
And the last rule of game is you can only have 1 joker. I mean 1 or 0. Let's assume you have joker and you guessed the next numbers then you can't take that joker but your previous joker is going to protected.
I don't write this text as Turkish because game is already Turkish.
